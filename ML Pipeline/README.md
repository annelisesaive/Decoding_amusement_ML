# ML pipeline to decode amusement intensity over time

### Objective
We used a machine-learning approach to predict humorous amusement over time using facial expressions and video features. The code describes the supervised Random Forest (RF) and ML pipeline we used for amusement decoding. We ran these classifications across different time intervals to characterize the dynamic variations of amusement
